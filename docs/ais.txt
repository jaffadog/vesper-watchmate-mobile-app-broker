Turn rate is encoded as follows:

0 to +126 = turning right at up to 708 deg per min or higher
0 to -126 = turning left at up to 708 deg per min or higher 
Values between 0 and 708 deg per min coded by ROTAIS = 4.733 SQRT(ROTsensor) degrees per min
where ROTsensor is the Rate of Turn as input by an external Rate of Turn Indicator (TI). ROTAIS is rounded to the nearest integer value.
+127 = turning right at more than 5 deg per 30 s (No TI available)
-127 = turning left at more than 5 deg per 30 s (No TI available)
-128 (80 hex) indicates no turn information available (default).
ROT data should not be derived from COG information.
